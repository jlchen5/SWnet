### Model Code

As shown below, SWnet adopts a dual converge architercture.Genomic signature and chemical fingerprints are porcessed in parallel through GNN and CNN layers to extract independent features, which are then concatenated. And SWnet also integrate multi-task learning and self-attentation mechanism to further improve the performance.
The code for the SWnet can be found in `multi-task, self-attention, single-layer`.

### Evaluation on pretrained model
* `cd self-attention/`
* `python SWnet_GDSC_self-attention_evaluate.py `
* `python SWnet_CCLE_self-attention_evaluate.py `
### or

### Train a prediction model on GDSC data
#### Prepare graph data, we can set the radius parameter to 1, 2, 3 or 4
* `cd data/GDSC/` 
* `python preprocess_drug_graph.py --radius 1`

#### Prepare drug similarity data
* `cd data/GDSC/`
* `python preprocess_drug_similarity.py`

#### Train self-attention SWnet 
* `cd self-attention/`
* `python SWnet_GDSC_self-attention_train.py `

you can set hyper-parameter like this:
* `python SWnet_GDSC_self-attention_train.py --radius 3 --split_case 0 --layer_gnn 3`

#### Evaluate self-attention SWnet
* `cd self-attention/`
* `python SWnet_GDSC_self-attention_evaluate.py `

### or

### Train a prediction model on CCLE data
#### Prepare graph data, we can set the radius parameter to 1, 2 ,3 or 4
* `cd data/CCLE/`
